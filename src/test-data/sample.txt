Sample Blog Post

This is a sample blog post that we'll use for testing our PDF parsing functionality.

Key Points:
1. Testing PDF upload
2. Testing content extraction
3. Verifying text formatting

The content should be properly extracted and maintained when processed through our application.

This is just a simple example, but in real usage, the PDF files might contain more complex formatting, tables, and other elements that need to be handled appropriately.
